# Infra7/Postgres
This is the official Postgres image but with security updates applied to the base image and gosu replaced by su-exec.

## How to use
Please refer to the PostgreSQL official [README.md](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md) for it's docker images.

## Future
In the future we'll consider to build the images from scratch, building the software instead of use distro packages.
